# PS5 Media Renamer

A lightweight utility that automatically organizes and renames PS5 capture files (videos and screenshots) into clean, sequential filenames.  
It scans your PS5 media folders and renames files based on their game directory, making it much easier to manage, archive, or share your gameplay content.

### TLDR
Download the "PS5 Media Renamer V1" executable in the Releases section and run it inside the PS5 directory you copied from your PS5

---

## 🚀 Features

- Automatically renames PS5 screenshots and video clips  
- Generates clean, sequential filenames  
- Skips files that have already been processed  
- Scans both `PS5` and `CREATE` directory structures  
- Zero-setup: just run the `.exe` next to or inside your PS5 folder

## 📥 How to Run

Place `ps5_media_renamer.exe` either:

- **Next to** your PS5 directory, or  
- **Inside** your PS5 directory

Then simply execute the file.

### Notes

- This tool **renames files only** — nothing is deleted.  
- Files that have already been renamed will be skipped if re-copied.  
- The program will scan these folders (if present):  
  - `/CREATE/Screenshots`  
  - `/CREATE/Video Clips`
